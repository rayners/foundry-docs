# Simple Calendar Compatibility Bridge

A Foundry VTT module that provides **Simple Calendar API compatibility** for Foundry v13+ calendar modules like **Seasons & Stars**.

## Overview

The Simple Calendar Compatibility Bridge acts as a translation layer between modules that expect the Simple Calendar API and Foundry v13+ calendar implementations. This allows you to use v13+ compatible calendar modules while maintaining compatibility with existing modules that depend on Simple Calendar.

## Key Features

- **Complete API Coverage**: Implements the full Simple Calendar API surface (50+ methods)
- **Automatic Detection**: Uses S&S Integration Interface for seamless integration
- **Hook Bridging**: Translates between S&S hooks and Simple Calendar hook formats
- **CSS/DOM Compatibility**: Dynamically adds all required Simple Calendar CSS classes and DOM structure
- **Zero Configuration**: Just install and it works
- **Clean Architecture**: Complete separation of concerns between calendar and compatibility layers

## Supported Calendar Modules

- ‚úÖ **Seasons & Stars v2.0+** - Full support via Integration Interface
- ‚úÖ **Seasons & Stars v1.x** - Legacy support via wrapper
- üîÑ **Other calendar modules** - Extensible architecture for future integrations

## Compatible Modules

This bridge enables the following modules to work with modern calendar systems:

### ‚úÖ **Tested & Supported**
- **SmallTime** - Time display widget with complete integration
- **Simple Weather** - Weather system with core features fully working:
  - ‚úÖ Sidebar button integration on calendar widgets
  - ‚úÖ Weather data storage in calendar notes (when "Store weather in Simple Calendar notes" is enabled)
  - ‚úÖ Season-based weather using calendar season information
  - ‚úÖ All attachment modes (attached/detached to calendar)
  - ‚ö†Ô∏è Basic sunrise/sunset times (6 AM/6 PM defaults)
  - ‚ö†Ô∏è Simple season detection (month-range based)

### üîÑ **Expected to Work**
- **Calendar/Weather** - Advanced weather systems
- Any module expecting Simple Calendar API

## Why Use This Bridge?

### For Foundry v13 Users

Simple Calendar doesn't currently support Foundry v13, but many modules still depend on it. This bridge lets you:

- Use Foundry v13+ compatible calendar modules like Seasons & Stars  
- Keep all your existing calendar-dependent modules working
- Get the best of both worlds: v13+ calendar features + existing module compatibility

### For Module Developers

- **Focused Development**: Calendar modules can focus on calendar functionality without Simple Calendar compatibility
- **Reduced Maintenance**: No need to maintain Simple Calendar compatibility in each module
- **Extensibility**: Easy to add support for new calendar modules
