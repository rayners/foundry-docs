## Configuration

Simple Weather works with standard configuration when using the compatibility bridge:

### Weather Settings

All standard Simple Weather settings work:
- **Climate Selection**: Choose hot, temperate, or cold climate
- **Humidity Level**: Select barren, modest, or verdant conditions
- **Season Control**: Use calendar seasons or manual override
- **Temperature Units**: Celsius or Fahrenheit display
- **Player Visibility**: Control what players can see

### Calendar Integration Settings

- **Attach to Calendar**: Enable for sidebar integration with calendar widgets
- **Store in Calendar Notes**: Enable for weather persistence between sessions
- **Show Date/Time**: Display calendar date and time information
- **Auto Generate**: Automatically create weather when date changes

## Season Mapping

The bridge properly maps calendar seasons to Simple Weather:

| Calendar Season Icon | Simple Weather Season |
|---------------------|----------------------|
| `spring` | Spring |
| `summer` | Summer |
| `fall` | Fall |
| `winter` | Winter |

### Custom Calendar Support

For custom calendars in Seasons & Stars:
1. Set up seasons in your calendar configuration
2. Assign standard season icons (spring, summer, fall, winter) to your seasons
3. Simple Weather will automatically use the correct season for weather generation

## Weather Persistence

When "Store weather in Simple Calendar notes" is enabled:

### How It Works
1. **Note Creation**: Weather data stored as journal entries with calendar date flags
2. **Flag Storage**: Complete weather data stored in `simple-weather.dailyWeather` flags
3. **Date Lookup**: Weather retrieved when revisiting previous dates
4. **Legacy Support**: Works with existing Simple Weather note formats

### Note Structure
- **Title**: "Simple Weather - Daily Weather"
- **Content**: "Today's weather: [temperature] - [description]"
- **Flags**: Complete WeatherData object including climate, humidity, season info
- **Date Key**: Internal date mapping for efficient retrieval

### Benefits
- Weather history persists between sessions
- GMs can review past weather when players ask "what was the weather like yesterday?"
- Consistent weather when time travel or flashbacks occur
- Full weather data available for custom scripting

## User Interface

### GM Interface

- **Forecast Display**: 7-day weather forecast with hover details
- **Calendar Integration**: Weather buttons appear on calendar widgets
- **Manual Weather**: Override weather for special events or locations

### Player Interface
- **Limited Controls**: Configurable visibility of weather information
- **Date Display**: Current calendar date and time from calendar module
- **Weather Display**: Current weather conditions and temperature
- **Chat Integration**: Weather announcements in chat when configured

## Troubleshooting

### Weather Not Generating?
1. **Check Calendar Module**: Ensure Seasons & Stars is active and configured
2. **Verify Bridge**: Look for "Simple Calendar Compatibility Bridge | Ready" in console
3. **Season Setup**: Ensure calendar has seasons with standard icons
4. **Simple Weather Settings**: Check "Sync with Simple Calendar" is enabled

### Weather Not Persisting?
1. **Enable Note Storage**: Turn on "Store weather in Simple Calendar notes"
2. **GM Permissions**: Only GMs can create/modify weather notes
3. **Check Journal**: Look for "Simple Weather - Daily Weather" entries
4. **Flag Data**: Weather data should be in entry flags

### Missing Sidebar Buttons?
1. **Attachment Mode**: Enable "Attach to Calendar" in Simple Weather settings
2. **Calendar Widgets**: Ensure calendar widgets are visible
3. **Module Load Order**: Calendar â†’ Bridge â†’ Simple Weather
4. **Browser Console**: Check for integration messages

### Season Not Syncing?
1. **Season Icons**: Use standard season icons in calendar configuration
2. **Manual Override**: Check if season is manually set instead of "Sync"
3. **Calendar Configuration**: Verify seasons are properly configured
4. **Hemisphere**: Consider manual season override for southern hemisphere
