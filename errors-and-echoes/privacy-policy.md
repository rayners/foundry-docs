# Privacy Policy

Privacy policy for the Errors and Echoes module and error reporting system.

## Overview

Errors and Echoes is designed with privacy as a fundamental principle. This privacy policy explains how the module handles data collection, processing, and storage when error reporting is enabled.

**Key Principle**: Error reporting is entirely opt-in and no data is collected without explicit user consent.

## Information We Collect

### When Error Reporting is Disabled (Default)

When error reporting is disabled (the default state), Errors and Echoes:
- **Does not collect any data**
- **Does not transmit any information**
- **Does not contact external servers**
- Only provides local error reporting capabilities to other modules

### When Error Reporting is Enabled

When a Game Master explicitly enables error reporting, we may collect:

#### Technical Information
- **Error messages and stack traces** (sanitized to remove personal information)
- **Module identification** (which module caused the error)
- **Foundry VTT version** and **game system information**
- **Browser type and version** (general categories only)
- **List of active modules** (names and versions only)
- **Anonymous session identifier** (changes daily, cannot be traced to individuals)

#### Module Context (Optional)
- **Module configuration settings** (non-personal)
- **Feature usage information** (non-personal)
- **Performance metrics** (timing, memory usage)

## Information We DO NOT Collect

We never collect:
- **User names or real names**
- **Email addresses or contact information**
- **IP addresses** (beyond basic routing)
- **Character names or game content**
- **Chat messages or private communications**
- **User passwords or authentication tokens**
- **Personal file paths** (sanitized before transmission)
- **Any personally identifiable information (PII)**

## How We Use Information

Collected data is used solely for:
- **Identifying and fixing bugs** in Foundry VTT modules
- **Improving module stability** and performance
- **Understanding compatibility issues** between modules and systems
- **Providing better user experiences** through error prevention

We do not use collected data for:
- Marketing or advertising
- User tracking or profiling
- Commercial purposes beyond module improvement
- Sharing with third parties (except as required by law)

## Data Storage and Security

### Storage Location
- Error reports are forwarded to module authors' chosen error monitoring services
- The Errors and Echoes module itself does not store error data
- Each module author is responsible for their own data handling practices

### Security Measures
- All data transmission uses HTTPS encryption
- Error reports are sanitized to remove potential personal information
- Anonymous session IDs rotate daily and cannot be linked to individuals
- Rate limiting prevents abuse and excessive data collection

### Data Retention
- Module authors set their own data retention policies
- We recommend automatic deletion after 90 days for privacy compliance
- Users can request data deletion at any time (see User Rights below)

## User Rights and Controls

### Privacy Controls
- **Opt-in Requirement**: Error reporting must be explicitly enabled by a Game Master
- **Privacy Levels**: Choose from Minimal, Standard, or Detailed data collection
- **Module-Specific Control**: Enable/disable reporting for individual modules
