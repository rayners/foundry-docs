# Travel System

Manage your party's journeys across the world with J&J's travel mechanics.

:::warning Alpha Feature
Journey tracking features are partially implemented. Some buttons exist but have limited functionality.
:::

## Travel Status

Set your party's current activity to reflect what they're doing:

| Status | Description | Use When |
|--------|-------------|----------|
| **Traveling** | Party is on the move | During active travel between locations |
| **Resting** | Taking a break | Short stops for meals or brief rest |
| **Camping** | Set up for the night | Extended rest periods, overnight camps |

To change travel status:
1. Open the party sheet
2. Go to the **Travel tab**
3. Select status from the dropdown

## Journey Tracking

Track your party's progress across the world:

### Setting Up a Journey

1. Navigate to the **Travel tab**
2. Fill in journey details:
   - **Origin**: Where you're starting from
   - **Destination**: Where you're heading
   - **Total Distance**: How far the journey is
   - **Distance Traveled**: Progress so far
   - **Terrain Type**: The primary terrain you're crossing

### Movement Calculation

Movement rates depend on your game system and party composition:

#### Dragonbane Movement
- **On Foot**: 15 km per day
- **Mounted**: 30 km per day
- **Mixed Party**: Uses the slower rate

:::tip
The GM can adjust base movement in the Settings tab to match campaign needs.

## Travel Actions

The Travel tab provides several action buttons for journey management:

### Available Actions

| Action | Purpose | Current Status |
|--------|---------|----------------|
| **Find Path** | Roll pathfinding checks | ðŸš§ Limited functionality |
| **Random Encounter** | Generate encounters | ðŸš§ Limited functionality |
| **Roll Weather** | Determine weather conditions | ðŸš§ Limited functionality |

## Travel Roles in Action

Travel roles (assigned in the Members tab) come into play during journeys:

### Pathfinder

### Resource Consumption

Default consumption rates (configurable in Settings):

:::important

:::

### Resource Warnings

The party sheet provides visual warnings:
- Resources turn **red** when below party needs
- Warnings appear when supplies run low
- Automatic calculations based on party size

## Best Practices

### Planning Journeys
