A comprehensive party management system for Foundry VTT, initially designed for the Dragonbane RPG.

## About

Journeys & Jamborees transforms how groups handle travel, resources, and party dynamics by treating the party as a cohesive unit with its own character sheet. Instead of juggling individual character inventories and tracking party resources across multiple sheets, J&J provides a unified Party actor that serves as the central hub for group activities.

## Core Concept

The module introduces a new actor type - the Party - which represents your adventuring group as a whole. This party actor has its own sheet where players can:

- Manage party membership and character status
- Assign travel roles like pathfinder, lookout, and quartermaster
- Track shared resources such as food, water, and gold
- Maintain a party inventory separate from individual characters
- Record the party's journey and important events

Players can assign their characters to the party, and the system automatically handles permissions so everyone can contribute to party management while maintaining appropriate boundaries.

## Why Journeys & Jamborees?

Traditional VTTs handle individual characters well, but party-level activities often require manual coordination and bookkeeping. J&J solves this by providing dedicated tools for:

- **Shared Resource Management**: No more asking "who's carrying the rations?"
- **Travel Coordination**: Everyone knows their role and the party's destination
- **Group Decisions**: See at a glance who's participating in activities
- **Campaign Continuity**: Track the party's story across sessions
