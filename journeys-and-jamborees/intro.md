# Journeys & Jamborees

Welcome to the Journeys & Jamborees documentation! This module brings comprehensive party management to Foundry VTT, allowing your adventuring group to share resources, manage travel together, and collaborate more effectively.

## What is Journeys & Jamborees?

Journeys & Jamborees (J&J) is a Foundry VTT module that introduces a new actor type specifically designed for managing adventuring parties. It provides tools for:

- **Shared Resource Management**: Track party-wide resources like food, water, and gold
- **Travel System**: Manage overland travel with assigned roles and automatic movement calculation
- **Member Management**: Track which characters are active, traveling, or staying behind
- **Collaborative Inventory**: Maintain a shared party inventory separate from individual character inventories
- **Permission Management**: Automatic permission handling for party members

## Key Features

### Party Actor Type
A dedicated actor type that represents your adventuring party, complete with its own sheet and data model.

### Travel Roles

- **Pathfinder**: Guides the party through the wilderness
- **Lookout**: Watches for danger and opportunities
- **Quartermaster**: Manages resources and supplies
