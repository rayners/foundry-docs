## Configuring for Your System

### Step 1: Check System Detection
When you first enable the module, it automatically detects your game system and loads appropriate defaults.

### Step 2: Adjust Movement Rates
1. Open module settings
2. Set appropriate movement rates for your system
3. Change units if needed (miles vs kilometers)

### Step 3: Configure Skills
1. The module detects available skills automatically
2. Select which skills match each travel role
3. If skills aren't showing, create a character with skills first

### Step 4: Set Dice Formulas
1. Configure encounter rolls for your system's mechanics
2. Adjust threshold values as needed
3. Set weather dice if your system uses weather rules

## Adding Support for New Systems

### For Users

If your system isn't pre-configured:

1. **Use Default Settings**: The module will work with generic defaults
2. **Manual Configuration**: Adjust all settings manually for your system
3. **Share Your Config**: Post your settings on GitHub to help others

### For Developers

To add official support for a new system:

1. **Fork the Repository**
2. **Add System Configuration** in `src/system-config.ts`:
   ```typescript
   export const SYSTEM_CONFIGS = {
     'your-system-id': {
       movement: {
         onFoot: 24,
         mounted: 48,
         units: 'miles'
       },
       skills: {
         pathfinderSkillName: 'navigation',
         lookoutSkillName: 'perception',
         quartermasterSkillName: 'logistics'
       },
       dice: {
         encounterFormula: '1d20',
         encounterThreshold: 15,
         weatherFormula: '2d6'
       },
       defaultPartyImage: 'icons/your-system/party.png'
     }
   };
   ```

3. **Create System Adapter** in `src/system-adapter.ts`:
   ```typescript
   class YourSystemAdapter extends SystemAdapter {
     getSkillValue(actor, skillName) {
       // Return the skill value for your system
     }
     
     async rollSkill(actor, skillName, options) {
       // Implement skill rolling for your system
     }
   }
   ```

4. **Test Thoroughly** with your system
5. **Submit a Pull Request**

## Troubleshooting

### Skills Not Appearing
- Create at least one character with skills
- Check that the system is properly detected
- Try reloading the world

### Movement Calculations Wrong
- Verify units are set correctly
- Check that movement rates match your system's expectations
- Consider terrain modifiers in your calculations

### Dice Rolls Not Working
- Ensure dice formulas are valid Foundry expressions
- Test formulas in chat first: `/r 1d20`
- Check console for error messages

## API Access

Developers can access system configuration programmatically:

```javascript
const jjApi = game.modules.get('journeys-and-jamborees').api;
const config = jjApi.systemConfig.getCurrentSystemConfig();

console.log(config.movement.onFoot); // Base movement rate
console.log(config.skills.pathfinderSkillName); // Skill name
```

## Best Practices

1. **Test Your Configuration**: Make a test party and verify all features work
2. **Document Custom Settings**: Keep notes on your configuration
3. **Share With Community**: Help others with the same system
4. **Report Issues**: File bugs for system-specific problems
5. **Consider Automation**: Some systems may benefit from custom adapters
