Get up and running with Journeys & Jamborees in just a few minutes!

## Step 1: Create a Party Actor

2. Click **Create Actor**
3. Enter a name for your party (e.g., "The Adventuring Company")
4. Select **party** as the actor type
5. Click **Create Actor**

## Step 2: Open the Party Sheet

Double-click on your newly created party actor to open the party sheet. You'll see several tabs:

Alternatively, add characters individually:

2. Drop it onto the party sheet
3. The character is now a party member

## Step 4: Set Travel Roles

1. Go to the **Travel** tab
2. Assign roles by selecting characters:
   - **Pathfinder**: Guides the party
   - **Lookout**: Watches for danger
   - **Quartermaster**: Manages supplies

## Step 5: Manage Resources

1. In the party sheet header, you'll see resource trackers:
   - **Rations**: Food supplies
   - **Water**: Water supplies
   - **Gold**: Shared party funds

2. Click the numbers to edit them directly
3. Resources are automatically validated based on party size
