## Quick Start

### üêõ Report Bugs

Use our structured [bug report template](https://github.com/rayners/fvtt-journeys-and-jamborees/blob/main/.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/bug_report.md) which includes:

- Multi-system support (Dragonbane, D&D 5e, Pathfinder 2e, etc.)
- Environment details checklist
- Console error collection
- Reproduction steps format

#### Good Bug Report Example

```markdown
**Description**: Characters disappear from party when changing scenes

**Steps to Reproduce**:
1. Create party with 3 characters
2. Switch to different scene
3. Open party sheet

**Expected**: All 3 characters still in party
**Actual**: Only 1 character remains

**Environment**:
- Foundry: v11.315
- Dragonbane: v1.0.3
- Browser: Chrome 120
- OS: Windows 11

**Console Error**:
```
TypeError: Cannot read property 'id' of undefined
    at PartySheet._onDrop (party-sheet.js:142)
```
```

### üß™ Test the Module

Be an early adopter and help us improve:

#### Testing Focus Areas

- **Party Management**: Adding/removing characters
- **Resource Tracking**: Consumption calculations
- **Travel System**: Role assignments and status
- **Permissions**: Player vs GM capabilities
- **Edge Cases**: Unusual configurations

#### Testing Checklist

- [ ] Create parties with 1-10 characters
- [ ] Test all character status combinations
- [ ] Try all travel role assignments
- [ ] Verify resource warnings work
- [ ] Check permission boundaries
- [ ] Test with multiple players
- [ ] Try breaking things creatively!

### üí° Request Features

Use our [feature request template](https://github.com/rayners/fvtt-journeys-and-jamborees/blob/main/.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/feature_request.md) which includes:

- Game system compatibility checklist
- Integration considerations
- Use case descriptions

We welcome:
- **UX improvements** - Better workflows
- **Integration ideas** - Other module compatibility
- **Creative uses** - Unexpected applications
- **Accessibility** - Making J&J more inclusive

Before suggesting features:

  // Check permissions first
  if (!this.canUserModify(game.user, character)) {
