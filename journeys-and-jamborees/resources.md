# Resource Management

Keep your party supplied and ready for adventure with J&J's resource tracking system.

## Overview

Journeys & Jamborees tracks essential party resources that are consumed during travel and adventures. The system provides visual feedback and warnings to help you manage supplies effectively.

## Core Resources

### Rations
- **Purpose**: Food supplies for the party
- **Default Consumption**: 1 per character per day
- **Storage**: Party inventory

### Water
- **Purpose**: Drinking water for the party  
- **Default Consumption**: 1 per character per day
- **Storage**: Party inventory

### Gold
- **Purpose**: Shared party funds
- **Default Consumption**: None (manual tracking)
- **Storage**: Party sheet header

## Resource Display

Resources are displayed in multiple locations for easy access:

### Party Sheet Header
- Quick view of current resource levels
- Rations and water counters
- Gold display
- Visual warnings when low

### Inventory Tab
- Detailed resource management
- Add/remove buttons
- Item listing
- Quantity tracking

## Managing Resources

### Adding Resources

To increase resource counts:

1. **Via Inventory Tab**:
   - Navigate to the Inventory tab
   - Click the **+ button** next to the resource
   - Increase quantity as needed

2. **Direct Edit**:
   - Click on the resource number in the header
   - Type the new value
   - Press Enter to confirm

### Using Resources

To decrease resource counts:

1. **Manual Deduction**:
   - Click the **- button** to decrease by 1
   - Edit the number directly for larger changes

2. **Distribute Button**:
   - Use for role-playing resource allocation
   - Helps track who carries what (flavor only)

## Resource Warnings

The system provides automatic warnings:

### Visual Indicators
- **Green**: Sufficient resources
- **Red**: Insufficient for party size
- **Warning Icons**: When critically low

### Calculation Logic
- Checks resources against party size
- Only counts "Active" and "Traveling" members
- "Staying Behind" members don't consume resources

## Consumption Rates

### Default Rates

| Resource | Per Character | Per Day |
|----------|--------------|---------|
| Rations | 1 | Daily |
| Water | 1 | Daily |

### Customizing Rates

GMs can adjust consumption in the Settings tab:
- **Rations Per Character Per Day**
- **Water Per Character Per Day**
- Rates can be decimal values (e.g., 0.5 for half rations)

### Consumption Rules

Resources are consumed by:
- ✅ **Active** status characters
- ✅ **Traveling** status characters  
- ❌ **Staying Behind** characters (do not consume)

## Party Inventory

### Shared Storage

The party inventory is separate from character inventories:
- **Centralized management** of group resources
- **No weight tracking** (currently)
- **Accessible to all** party members

### Adding Items

1. **Create New Items**:
   - Click "Add" in the inventory
   - Fill in item details
   - Set quantity

2. **Drag from Characters**:
   - Open a character sheet
   - Drag items to party sheet
   - Items are copied (not moved)

### Managing Items

- **Edit**: Click the edit icon to modify
- **Delete**: Click trash icon to remove
- **Quantity**: Track stackable items
- **Notes**: Add descriptions as needed

## Best Practices

### Resource Planning

1. **Calculate Journey Needs**:
   - Days of travel × party size × consumption rate
   - Add 20-30% buffer for delays

2. **Stock Strategically**:
   - Buy in bulk at towns
   - Hunt/forage to supplement
   - Track water sources on map

### During Adventures

1. **Daily Deduction**:
   - Deduct at end of each travel day
   - Account for special circumstances
   - Note any resource finds

2. **Monitor Levels**:
   - Check before major decisions
   - Plan resupply stops
   - Consider splitting party if low

### GM Guidelines

1. **Resource Availability**:
   - Make resources meaningful but not tedious
   - Vary availability by region
   - Use scarcity for drama

2. **Automation Settings**:
   - Enable auto-consumption for ease
   - Adjust rates for campaign style
   - Use warnings to prompt decisions

## Advanced Usage

### Resource Types

Consider tracking additional resources:
- **Torches**: For dungeon exploration
- **Rope**: For climbing/traversal
- **Ammunition**: For ranged combat
- **Feed**: For mounts and animals

### Survival Scenarios

Resource management becomes critical during:
- **Desert Crossings**: Double water consumption
- **Winter Travel**: Extra rations needed
- **Sea Voyages**: No foraging possible
- **Dungeon Delves**: Limited resupply

### Economic Considerations

- **Bulk Discounts**: Reduce costs for large purchases
- **Regional Pricing**: Vary by availability
- **Trade Goods**: Some resources as currency
- **Spoilage**: Fresh food time limits

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Resources showing red despite having enough**:
- Check party member status
- Verify consumption settings
- Refresh the party sheet

**Cannot modify resource amounts**:
- Ensure you have party ownership
- Check if sheet is locked
- Try using +/- buttons instead

**Resources not consuming automatically**:
- Check auto-consumption setting
- Verify travel status
- Manual deduction may be required

## Future Enhancements

Planned improvements include:

### Automation
- Automatic daily consumption
- Rest-based deduction
- Foraging integration
- Water source tracking

### Expanded Resources
- Custom resource types
- Resource quality levels
- Spoilage tracking
- Container management

### Integration
- Shop connectivity
- Crafting system ties
- Survival skill bonuses
- Environmental effects
