# User Guide

Complete reference for Realms & Reaches features and workflows.

## Scene Controls *(GM Only)*

Realms & Reaches provides intelligent travel controls that automatically adapt to your scene configuration.

### Auto-Detection System

The module automatically detects the appropriate travel scale for each scene:

- **Realm Travel** (hex grids, km/miles/leagues): For overland travel and wilderness exploration
- **Region Travel** (square grids, ft/meters/yards): For tactical movement and local exploration

### Detection Priority

1. **Grid Type** *(primary)*: Hex grids ‚Üí Realm, Square grids ‚Üí Region
2. **Distance Units** *(fallback)*: km/miles/leagues ‚Üí Realm, ft/meters/yards ‚Üí Region  
3. **Manual Override** *(highest)*: Always respected when configured

### Configuring Scene Travel

1. **Right-click a scene** and select **Configure**
2. **Enable travel controls** checkbox to activate the feature
3. **Choose travel scale**:
   - **Auto-detect** *(default)*: Uses grid type and distance units
   - **Realm**: Force realm-scale travel controls
   - **Region**: Force region-scale travel controls  
   - **None**: Disable travel controls entirely

### Using Scene Controls

When enabled, travel controls appear in the scene toolbar:

#### Realm Scale Controls
- **Select Realm**: Click to select existing realm areas
- **Create Realm**: Launch realm creation dialog with drawing tools

#### Region Scale Controls  
- **Select Region**: Click to select existing local regions
- **Create Region**: Access standard Foundry region tools for tactical areas

### Integration with Standard Tools

- **Realm controls** integrate with the existing Region layer for polygon drawing
- **Region controls** use Foundry's built-in region creation workflow
- **Seamless workflow** between different scales of travel and exploration

:::tip Automatic Detection
This system allows GMs to work with travel data at the appropriate scale without manual configuration in most cases.

## Data Management

### Scene Storage

Realm data is automatically stored in scene flags and persists with your world:

#### Automatic Saving
- **Real-time**: Changes save immediately
- **Scene flags**: Data stored in scene flags
- **World backup**: Included in standard Foundry world backups

### Export System

#### Export Process
1. **Click Export** in layer controls
2. **Choose filename** (defaults to scene name)
3. **Select location** to save file
4. **File contains** all realm data plus metadata

#### Use Cases
- **Backup**: Regular export for data safety
- **Sharing**: Send to other GMs or players
- **Publishing**: Include with adventure modules
- **Migration**: Move data between worlds

### Import System

#### Import Process
1. **Click Import** in layer controls
2. **Select JSON file** to import
3. **Preview data** and conflicts
4. **Choose merge strategy**:
   - **Merge**: Add new realms, keep existing
   - **Replace**: Delete existing, add imported
   - **Skip conflicts**: Only add non-conflicting realms
5. **Confirm import**

## Advanced Techniques

### Layered Regions

Create complex environmental effects by overlapping realms:

#### Example: Mountain Forest
```
Base layer: biome:mountain, elevation:highland, travel_speed:0.6
Forest layer: biome:forest, terrain:dense, resources:timber
Combined effect: Mountain forest with slow travel and timber resources
```

### Complex Geometries

#### Irregular Coastlines
- Use polygon tool with many points
- Follow actual map features closely
- Consider performance vs. detail trade-offs

#### Urban Districts
- Rectangular regions for structured areas
- Overlapping circles for neighborhood boundaries
- Custom tags for district characteristics

### Performance Optimization

#### Large Datasets
- **Simplify geometry**: Reduce polygon point count
- **Strategic placement**: Focus on gameplay-relevant areas
- **Regular cleanup**: Remove unused or obsolete realms

## Campaign Integration

### Journeys & Jamborees Integration

#### Automatic Effects
When J&J integration is enabled:
- **Travel speeds** automatically modified by `travel_speed:` tags
- **Encounter tables** selected based on `biome:` tags
- **Weather effects** influenced by `climate:` tags

#### Setup
1. **Install both modules**
2. **Enable J&J integration** in settings
3. **Create realm data** with appropriate tags
4. **J&J automatically queries** realm data during travel

## Best Practices

### Design Principles

#### Start Simple
- Begin with basic biome and terrain tags
- Add complexity gradually as needed
- Focus on gameplay-relevant properties

#### Be Consistent
- Use the same tag values across your campaign
- Document your conventions for other GMs

### Tagging Strategies

#### Minimal Viable Tags
For quick setup, focus on:
- `biome:` for basic environment
- `travel_speed:` for movement mechanics
- One or two custom tags for flavor

#### Common Patterns

##### Wilderness Hexcrawl
```
Forest: biome:forest, terrain:dense, travel_speed:0.75, resources:timber
Plains: biome:grassland, terrain:sparse, travel_speed:1.25, resources:food
Mountains: biome:mountain, terrain:rocky, elevation:highland, travel_speed:0.5
```

##### Urban Campaign
```
Noble District: biome:cultivated, terrain:smooth, travel_speed:1.5, custom:wealthy
Docks: biome:coast, terrain:flat, travel_speed:1.0, resources:water
Slums: biome:cultivated, terrain:dense, travel_speed:0.75, custom:dangerous
```

## Keyboard Shortcuts

- **Escape**: Cancel current drawing or clear selection
- **Enter**: Complete polygon drawing
- **Delete**: Remove selected realm (with confirmation)

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### "Realms not appearing"
**Solutions**:
- Check the Realms layer is active (map icon highlighted)
- Verify you completed the shape (right-click or Enter)
- Try selecting with Select tool to highlight

#### "Properties dialog won't open"
**Solutions**:
- Ensure you have GM permissions
- Make sure a realm is selected (bright border)
- Try clicking directly on the realm area

#### "Tags showing as invalid"
**Solutions**:
- Check format: must be `key:value` with exactly one colon
- Verify characters: only letters, numbers, underscore, hyphen, period
- Try suggested values from autocomplete

#### "Performance problems"
**Solutions**:
- Reduce polygon complexity (fewer points)
- Use simpler shapes where possible
- Check browser hardware acceleration
