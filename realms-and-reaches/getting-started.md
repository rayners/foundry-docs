# Getting Started

Complete beginner's guide to creating your first realm data in just a few minutes.

## What You'll Learn

- Creating your first realm with drawing tools
- Adding tags to describe terrain and biome
- Basic realm management and organization
- Sharing and importing realm data

## Step 1: Your First Realm

Let's create a simple forest region to get familiar with the tools.

### Open the Realms Layer

1. **Navigate to any scene** (the Canvas tab)
2. **Look for the map icon** in the left sidebar controls
3. **Click it** to activate the Realms layer

You should now see the Realms & Reaches toolbar with several drawing tools.

### Draw a Forest

1. **Select the Polygon tool** (first drawing tool)
2. **Click around the scene** to place points forming a rough forest shape
   - Start with 4-5 points for simplicity
   - Don't worry about precision - you can always edit later
3. **Right-click or press Enter** to complete the polygon
4. **You should see a blue-tinted region** appear on your map

Congratulations! You've drawn your first realm.

### Add Properties

Now let's make this region represent a forest:

1. **Double-click your realm** (or select it and click Properties)
2. **The Realm Properties dialog** opens
3. **Give it a name**: Type "Ancient Forest" in the name field
4. **Add forest tag**: 
   - Click in the tag input field
   - Type `biome:forest`
   - Press Enter or click the + button
5. **Add terrain tag**:
   - Type `terrain:dense`
   - Press Enter to add
6. **Add speed modifier**:
   - Type `travel_speed:0.75` (means 75% normal speed)
   - Press Enter to add
7. **Click Save**

Your realm now has meaningful game data! Notice how the tags are color-coded by type.

## Step 2: Understanding Tags

Tags are the heart of Realms & Reaches. They describe what makes each region unique.

### Tag Format

All tags follow the pattern `key:value`:
- `biome:forest` (the biome is forest)
- `terrain:dense` (the terrain is dense)
- `travel_speed:0.75` (travel speed is 75% of normal)

### Common Tag Types

| Tag Type | Purpose | Examples |
|----------|---------|----------|
| `biome:` | Ecosystem type | `forest`, `desert`, `mountain`, `swamp` |
| `terrain:` | Movement difficulty | `dense`, `sparse`, `rocky`, `smooth` |
| `climate:` | Weather patterns | `temperate`, `arctic`, `tropical` |
| `travel_speed:` | Speed modifier | `0.5` (slow), `1.0` (normal), `1.5` (fast) |
| `resources:` | Available materials | `timber`, `game`, `minerals`, `water` |
| `custom:` | Unique properties | `haunted`, `sacred`, `dangerous` |

### Tag Suggestions

The tag editor provides autocomplete suggestions:
- Start typing `bio` and see `biome:` suggestions
- Type `biome:` and see forest, desert, mountain options
- Common patterns are suggested based on what you type

## Step 3: More Drawing Tools

Try the other drawing tools to create different types of regions:

### Rectangle Tool

Perfect for:
- Urban districts
- Farmland areas  
- Structured zones

**How to use:**
1. Select Rectangle tool
2. Click one corner
3. Click the opposite corner
4. The rectangle is complete

### Circle Tool  

Great for:
- Points of interest
- Magical effect zones
- Blast areas
- Resource deposits

**How to use:**
1. Select Circle tool
2. Click the center point
3. Click where you want the edge
4. The circle is complete

## Step 4: Practical Examples

Let's create a few different realm types to see the system in action:

### Desert Oasis

1. **Draw a small circle** in your scene
2. **Name it**: "Blessed Oasis"
3. **Add tags**:
   - `biome:oasis`
   - `climate:arid`
   - `resources:water`
   - `resources:food`
   - `travel_speed:1.25` (easy travel, good rest spot)

### Treacherous Mountains

1. **Draw an irregular polygon** with jagged edges
2. **Name it**: "Ironpeak Range"
3. **Add tags**:
   - `biome:mountain`
   - `terrain:rocky`
   - `elevation:highland`
   - `climate:arctic`
   - `travel_speed:0.4` (very slow)
   - `resources:minerals`
   - `custom:dangerous`

### Civilized Farmland

1. **Draw several rectangles** for field patterns
2. **Name them**: "Westbrook Farms", "Miller's Fields", etc.
3. **Add tags**:
   - `biome:cultivated`
   - `terrain:flat`
   - `travel_speed:1.2` (roads and clear paths)
   - `resources:food`
   - `custom:safe`

## Step 5: Saving and Sharing

### Automatic Saving

Realm data is automatically saved to your scene when you:
- Create new realms
- Modify existing realms
- Use the Properties dialog

No manual saving required!

### Export Your Work

1. **Click the Export button** in the Realms toolbar
2. **Choose your filename** (suggestion: `my-world-realms.json`)
3. **Save the file** somewhere safe

This creates a backup and allows sharing with others.

### Import Community Data

1. **Download realm data** from other creators
2. **Click the Import button** in the Realms toolbar
3. **Select the JSON file** to import
4. **Review the preview** and choose how to handle conflicts
5. **Click Import** to add the data to your scene

## Common Questions

### "My realm isn't showing up"

- Make sure the Realms layer is active (map icon highlighted)
- Check if you completed the drawing (right-click or Enter for polygons)
- Verify the polygon has at least 3 points

### "I can't edit realm properties"

- Make sure you have GM permissions
- Try double-clicking the realm directly
- Check that the realm is selected (highlighted border)

### "Tags aren't working"

- Verify the tag format: `key:value` with exactly one colon
- Check for typos in common tags (`biome:forrest` should be `biome:forest`)
- Invalid tags will show a red border with error message

### "How do I delete a realm?"

- Select the realm with the Select tool
- Press Delete or Backspace
- Confirm deletion in the dialog
- Or use the Delete button in the Properties dialog

### "Can I have overlapping realms?"

Yes! This is a feature:
- A region can be both `biome:forest` and `elevation:highland`
- Queries return the first match found
- Use this for layered environmental effects

## Next Steps

### Integration with Other Modules

If you have **Journeys & Jamborees** installed:
- Enable realm integration in J&J settings
- Your travel speeds and encounter tables will automatically use realm data
- Create biome-specific random encounter tables

### Advanced Tagging

Explore module-specific tags:
- `module:jj:encounter_chance:0.3` (30% encounter chance for J&J)
- `module:weather:storm_chance:high` (for weather modules)
- `module:magic:wild_magic:true` (for magic effect modules)

### Performance Tips

For large worlds:
- Use fewer, larger realms rather than many tiny ones
- Simple shapes (rectangles, circles) are faster than complex polygons
- Consider realm density - not every square foot needs a tag
